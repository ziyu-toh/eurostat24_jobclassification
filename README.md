An online job advertisement (OJA) is a digital posting aimed at attracting potential job seekers. These postings, often found on job portals, company websites, and other recruitment platforms, typically include details such as job descriptions, employer information, requirements, and benefits. To generate meaningful insights from OJA data, occupational class labels are assigned based on the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO), a taxonomy managed by the International Labour Organisation. ISCO categorizes occupations by educational levels across four tiers. 

In the Classification of Occupations for Online Job Advertisements Challenge, participants are tasked with creating automated methods to classify job advertisements according to ISCO labels using a multilingual dataset. The dataset includes job titles, descriptions, and identifiers, with the final evaluation conducted on a gold-standard subset not shared with participants. The competition dataset features 26,000 anonymized job advertisements collected from 400 European Union websites, derived from the European Web Intelligence Hub (WIH). This dataset is part of a larger initiative led by Eurostat and Cedefop to gather labor market intelligence. Participants must provide scripts in Python or R to classify occupations, addressing challenges like multilingual data handling and cross-linguality. The competition emphasizes robust, versatile methodologies for occupational classification across varied datasets.
